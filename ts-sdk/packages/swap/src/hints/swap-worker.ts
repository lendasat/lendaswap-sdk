/**
 * Ties the hint feed and the action model together into auto-execution.
 *
 * On a server status hint it verifies the swap against the chain
 * (`tracker.applyHint`) — the hint only makes the derivation faster, the chain
 * stays the source of truth. Then, on every derived action, it AUTO-RUNS the
 * recommended action when it is auto-safe (a claim) and SURFACES the rest — a
 * manual `fund`, or a refund the user must confirm — via `onActionRequired`, the
 * seam a frontend notification center plugs into.
 *
 * A failed auto-claim is RETRIED with backoff. Each retry first re-verifies
 * against chain (a forced `applyHint`) and only re-runs if the swap is still
 * claimable — so we never blindly re-submit a claim (which on EVM would waste gas
 * or double-submit). After the attempt budget is spent the swap is surfaced via
 * `onActionRequired`, so it is never silently stuck.
